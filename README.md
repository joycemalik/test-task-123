# Simple Test Web Page

A minimalist, single-file web application designed to display the text "This is a test". This project serves as a basic example of a simple HTML page with inline styling.

## How to Use

To use this application, simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. No special setup or server is required.

## Code Explanation

The `index.html` file contains a complete, self-contained web page.
It uses basic HTML structure (`html`, `head`, `body`) and includes:
- A `meta` tag for UTF-8 character encoding.
- A `meta` tag for responsive design (`viewport`).
- A `<title>` tag for the browser tab.
- Inline `<style>` within the `<head>` to center the content and apply basic styling to the `body` and `h1` elements for a clean presentation.
- A `<h1>` tag within the `<body>` to display the brief's text: "This is a test".

No external files or JavaScript are used, adhering to the minimalist, single-file requirement.
